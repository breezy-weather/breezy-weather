            It looks like the version in which you encounter the issue is not the [latest version](https://github.com/breezy-weather/breezy-weather/releases) of Breezy Weather. The latest version contains potential fixes and troubleshooting improvements, so we kindly ask you to update first. If you are getting updates from the F-Droid default repo, you don’t need to uninstall your currently installed version. If you can still reproduce your issue after updating, please re-open a new issue.

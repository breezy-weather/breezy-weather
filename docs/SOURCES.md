# Weather sources

This is a user-end guide to weather sources available in Breezy Weather. If you are a developer looking to add a new source in Breezy Weather, have a look at [contribute](../CONTRIBUTE.md).

**AccuWeather** is the most complete source, although you may not need so much completeness (not many people cares about ceiling, for example).

**Open-Meteo** is the only free and open source weather source on this list, and probably also the most privacy-friendly. It is nearly as complete as **AccuWeather**, however lacks major features (alerts, realtime precipitations and reverse geocoding).

When deciding about which source you want to use, accuracy of data is probably the most important criteria, however only you can know which one is the best for your country. If you're based in the USA, you could try [Forecast Advisor](https://forecastadvisor.com/), though it's worth noting it's missing comparison data for several of Breezy Weather's sources.

Additional sources are available to configure but requires an API key. You can find them at the bottom of this page.

Ultimate goal of the app would be to modularize as to have a main weather source, and then being able to complete “precipitations in next hour” and “alerts” from one or more sources.

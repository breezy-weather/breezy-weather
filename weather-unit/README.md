# Breezy Weather unit conversion and formatting library

Android library to handle:
- Unit conversion
- Formatting in various languages, including on devices without ICU support or with missing CLDR data, with a simplified backport (no handling of plural and non-nominative rules)

Syntax inspired by [Kotlin duration](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/time-measurement.html#time-sources).

Some precision may be lost during conversions.

Very early work

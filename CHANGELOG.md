**IMPORTANT changes**
- `gplay` flavor was removed, Fused location is now available natively in all flavors for Android >= 12 with no proprietary library. Migration path: use the `standard` flavor

- OpenWeatherMap OneCall API will no longer be available without requiring billing information in June 2024. As a consequence, we switched to other endpoints that unfortunately don’t support alerts and minutely. You will have to use a different secondary source if you want to keep receiving these info. If you use a custom API key, you might want to make sure your API key is subscribed to the following products: Current and 3-hourly.
- If you were using “Send data to Gadgetbridge” feature, you will need to go back to `Settings` > `Widgets` to define which apps you want to send data to
- Lunar calendar is no longer available on Android < 7.0

**New feature**

# Version 5.1.8 (2024-03-30)

**New features**
- Added ability to change the background weather and time for each location

**Weather sources**

# Version 5.1.7 (2024-03-20)

**Improvements and fixes**
- [Privacy] If you enabled sending data to Gadgetbridge, Breezy Weather will no longer share your longitude, latitude and if your location is your current position with Gadgetbridge or any other app.
- [Privacy] The “Send weather data to Gadgetbridge” option was renamed “Broadcast my weather data to other apps” as any app can “pretend to be Gadgetbridge”. A confirmation dialog will appear to make the user confirm they fully understand the risks.
- [Privacy] The “Send weather data to Gadgetbridge” (which is off by default, unless you enabled it) will be turned off on all devices on update to let users decide if they still want to enable it.
- For sources not providing colors, we now make the color of the alert dynamic based on severity instead of always orange. This scale is the same as the one used by World Meteorological Organization and may differ with colors usually provided by your national provider. For sources without severity, this will fallback to Unknown color.

**Weather sources**
- Updated recommendations for new locations (existing locations must be modified manually, or re-added):

| Location  | Source type | Old         | New                |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|--------------------|

More improvements will come in later versions (mostly on widgets).


# Version 5.1.5 (2024-03-16)

*Just a re-release of v5.1.4 to include some technical build adjustments to prepare for release in default F-Droid repo.*

**Translations**
- Translations updated


# Version 5.1.4-beta (2024-03-16)

**New features**
- We now have our own repo for F-Droid and Google Play flavors of Breezy Weather. If you want to switch from our current repo (Standard flavor) to a different flavor, you should remove the repo for the Standard flavor first to avoid getting updates for the wrong flavor. [Link to Breezy Weather F-Droid repos](https://github.com/breezy-weather/fdroid-repo/blob/main/README.md)

**Weather sources**
- [World Meteorological Organization (WMO) Severe Weather] Added experimental support as secondary alert source. Translations are not supported (yet). Please report as soon as possible if you encounter a refresh error, making sure you mention the country of your location in the issue.
- [ECCC] Add sunshine duration
- [Natural Earth] Improve detection of small islands/countries
- [Recosanté] Fix refresh error on Friday
- Updated recommendations for new locations (existing locations must be modified manually, or re-added):

|----------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| France   | Pollen      | Open-Meteo  | Recosanté   |

**Improvements and fixes**
- Background weather update will now only process the first location, unless you have multi cities usage. This makes the process more green and efficient, and other secondary locations will automatically be updated when you open them instead (this means that if you don’t check these locations very often, it will no longer uselessly refresh them in the background). A document has been written to describe in details how the full weather update process work: https://github.com/breezy-weather/breezy-weather/blob/main/docs/UPDATES.md
- Fix AccuWeather being the default weather source instead of automatic recommendations
- Fix "Please wait a few seconds before retrying" when adding a location
- Fix some sources not being available for current location if current location didn’t change

**Translations**
- Translations updated


# Version 5.1.0-beta (2024-03-08)

**New features**
- Breezy Weather now comes in 3 flavors:
  - Standard: this is the version you used so far
  - Google Play: same as Standard + proprietary Fused location from Google Play Services. Useful if you use “Current location” feature AND have Google Play Services installed on your device. Otherwise, you should use the standard version.
  - F-Droid: this version removes support for any weather sources which are not libre and self-hostable, so you are sure to get a 100% FOSS experience and not connect by mistake to a non-free network. There are plans to add this version to the default F-Droid repository.

**Fixes**
- Fix crash when adding more than 4 or 5 current details in header
- Fix weather source failing in loop (noticed with NWS source, for example)
- Fallback to real temperature if feels like temperature is missing in daily feels like chart to avoid weird looking chart


# Version 5.0.0-alpha (2024-02-26)

We found a proprietary dependency in the database component. To get rid of it, we chose to use a different database component and not offer any migration. You will have to re-add your locations. Your preferences are safe.

This an **alpha release**. Use it at your own risk. If you do, report any issue you found to help stabilizing the app! Stay on v4.6.14 for now if you want a stable release and are not concerned about the proprietary dependency.

Unfinished things that will be in a future 5.0.x version:
- Bring back temporarily removed "auto" option for live wallpaper
- Offline reverse geocoding to get location presets for current location
- [UX] Improve weather sources dialog to be less overwhelming
- Maybe release a stable v4.6.15 that inform users that next version will empty location list, if there are too many reports

**New features and main improvements**
- Design refresh of current details in header
- New daily chart: feels like temperature
- New hourly chart: feels like temperature
- New hourly chart: humidity / dew point
- New hourly chart: pressure
- New hourly chart: cloud cover
- New hourly chart: visibility
- Better precipitation notifications, now based on precipitation minute by minute (not supported by all weather sources)
- Location search no longer asks you to choose your weather source, which may have been confusing. Instead, you will make a search, and when tapping on a location in the result list, location will be set up with a preset of main and secondary sources we recommend that varies depending on the country of that location. You are able to change these sources before confirming adding of that location. At the moment, this only affects manually added locations and experience of adding of current location remains unchanged due to technical reasons (no reverse geocoding available).
- Following that change, the purpose of the “Change source” button on bottom of location search is to change the default location search source (which was previously found rather hidden in settings) instead of the weather source to use with locations.

**Weather sources**
- [Danmarks Meteorologiske Institut (DMI)] Added support as a worldwide main source, with alerts for Denmark-only
- [Danmarks Meteorologiske Institut (DMI)] Added support as a secondary source for alerts in Denmark-only

- [HERE] Remove support for NWS alerts, they were never filtered according to the location (was returning all alerts from USA!), so use directly NWS source instead
- [HERE] Remove as a location search source as other sources are more reliable to be used with the new location search page

**Other improvements and fixes**
- [Weather refresh] Various improvements to missing data computing/extrapolating
- [Alerts] Show alert color icon on alert details page
- [Location list] Swiping left on a manually added location now opens the weather sources preferences instead of (un)setting resident location status
- [Location weather sources preferences] Clarified features supported by main source in secondary weather sources preferences. For exemple, at the moment of writing, Open-Meteo doesn't support alerts. If your main source is Open-Meteo and you don't have a secondary source set for Alerts, it showed “Main source”, now it will show “None” instead.
- [Location weather sources preferences] Fix secondary source choices not updating when changing main weather source (if main source supports secondary features, it wouldn't be showing in secondary sources list)
- [Location weather sources preferences] Fix a display issue of “alert source” instead of “normals source” in secondary weather sources settings of a location
- [Location weather sources preferences] Fix duplicate location when main weather source is changed to an existing same location with same weather source

- [Settings] When background updates are disabled, make user aware that “Notifications of weather alerts” and “Notifications of precipitations” are unavailable by greying the options in settings
- [Widgets] Fix clock day vertical widget in vertical or tile mode was showing decimals to current temperature
- Fix UV index description being sometimes wrong
- Fix all alert dialogs that had too much padding in content compared to title.

**Removed features**
- Resident locations. Undocumented, encourages bad practices (two identical locations to be refreshed) and terrible technical implementation. May be brought back differently if you can provide well-thought use cases, functional specifications, and a better technical implementation.
- Widget layout option “Oreo (Google Sans)” (Oreo without Google Sans remains available). We don’t have licensing rights of the Google Sans font. Customizing font on widgets was also an unofficial feature that was removed with a security update released in 2021, so that feature didn’t work for most devices anyway.

- Temperature unit will now follow locale preference if it was never defined. Example: you were using the app with the temperature unit set as Celsius (the previous default) in English (US).

# Version 4.6.0-beta (2023-08-16)

This new version introduces major changes in the way weather refreshes. While it brings nice new features with it, as there are now many different combination for weather sources that we can’t fully test, we welcome your bug reports about any regression introduced in this version, so we can fix them before new release becomes stable.

**New data**
- Yesterday is now shown as a day in daily forecast (on supported sources).
- Temperature normals added (with a fallback to average temperature when not supported by source).
- As a consequence “yesterday temperature lines” have been replaced by “temperature normals lines”.

**Weather refresh**
- If weather source doesn’t already provide it, app will now keep history back to yesterday 00:00. This will allow you to see details of the previous day, and will ensure a day is always full (daytime was notably missing on MET Norway source after 18:00). Works best 48 hours after a location has been added.
- When one or more secondary weather sources fail, app will refresh other sources that succeeded and restore cached data for failing sources. An error will still be displayed to inform you in case you need to take action.
- App will now tell you which source is failing.
- When changing a source, app will now automatically refresh data instead of expecting the user to force refresh manually.
- Secondary weather sources will no longer silently fail.
- Background update will now silently fail in the following cases to avoid unnecessary notification spam: network unavailable, server timeout. No weather update will happen.
- Background update will now silently fail in the following cases to avoid unnecessary notification spam: location permission missing (background location permission missing will still be reported), Android location not enabled, current location could not be found. Weather update will happen with previously found position. If current location was never found at least once, it will be reported as an error (will NOT silently fail).
- App will no longer show any message about data still being valid or refresh restrictions, it will automatically handle it, including merging still valid data with invalid data that just got refreshed (can happen when using multiple sources).

**Weather sources**
- [AccuWeather] Add support for temperature normals.
- [Météo-France] Add support for temperature normals.
- [Météo-France] Add support for temperature normals as a secondary source.

**Design**
- Logo got a refresh.
- Add a third place to the location list icon to not make it confusing with “itinerary” icon.
- A circled dot symbol is now shown next to location name on main screen if using current location.

**Other improvements and fixes**
- Fix incorrect alert source leading to crash in some cases.
- Required swipe distance to go to next location is now 50 % screen width (instead of 20 %) to make it less prone to errors.
- Current location will no longer wait 10 seconds to get a GPS fix if the info is available sooner
- Wind direction is fixed in hourly trends.
- Fix missing credits for secondary features when same as main source.
- Make alerts always take full width on alerts full page

**Translations**
- Initial support for Norwegian Bokmål added (thank you @Visnes!)
- Latvian translation is now complete (thank you Niks Rodžers!)
- Translations updated


# Version 4.5.4-beta (2023-08-10)

Some users reported issues with API limit reached, please check if you use OpenWeather or Pirate Weather as your main or secondary weather source!
Improvements to the error handling will be worked on for next major version.

**Weather sources**
- [PirateWeather] Bundled API key removed as monthly limit was reached on the 10th of the month (meaning it can’t be used again before Sep 1st) and we don’t want make false hopes to users by showing it in the list of available sources.

**Other fixes**
- Fix air quality data disappearing when allergen set as secondary source (but not air quality), and allergen data disappearing when air quality set as secondary source (but not allergen)
- Day / Night mode for locations has been moved to a new preference. It will also apply to some dialogs of the location now (others are still WIP).
- Change location list icon to use multiple place points instead of a bookmark (for "saved" locations)
- Fix clock icon tint on Android versions < 7.0

**Translations**
- Latvian translation added (thanks Eduards Lusts!), only app name translated for the moment

**New features**
- Support for secondary weather sources, allows you to complete missing data with other sources (air quality, allergens, precipitations by minute, alerts). Available from the “Edit” button in the footer of the main screen.
- IP.SB is now available as an alternative to GPS and Baidu IP Location. It’s based on IP so it provides less accurate results than GPS, but it’s fast and provides rather close results in our experience. Use it if you would like to use current location without giving your exact GPS position to weather source.
- Add a setting to allow changing the default location search source for weather sources which don’t have a location search feature.
- Add GeoNames as optional location search source. This source has fuzzy search support, but is rate-limited so only switch if you need it.

# Version 4.4.0-beta (2023-07-25)

This version brings new logic that automatically completes missing data (for example, uses hourly data to extrapolate daily value for this data). This logic which was initially implemented per source is now transparently implemented for all sources. This means that even novice developers that want to add new sources will now be able to do it without having to care about that, making this task easier than ever.

If you notice any data that was available on v4.3.0-beta for a source and is now missing on v4.4.0-beta, please report it in a GitHub issue.

- When current details are missing from a source, app will now pick the closest hour forecast. Following this change, some sources will now have more current details.
- Sun & Moon & Moon phase is now available for all sources, it will be computed if data is missing from source.
- This fixes an issue with MET Norway where icons were always daytime on days 2+ due to missing sun info
- This also fixes many errors with midnight sun and polar night.
- Fix day and night temperature for OpenWeather which was completely broken and could show higher temperature at night than during the day.
- When dew point is missing and relative humidity and air temperature are available, it will be automatically computed.
- When degree day is missing, it will be calculated according to EU formula (check [Day details documentation](docs/DAY_DETAILS.md) for more info).
- When degree day is 0, it will no longer be shown.
- When temperature < 10 °C and wind speed > 4.8 km/h, and wind chill temperature is missing, it will be automatically computed.

- Remove clunky last daily forecast on Open-Meteo, MF, MET No, OpenWeather to avoid showing incomplete/incorrect data
- “Alerts to follow” message will no longer take you to past alerts, and alert list page will no longer show past alerts
- Fix contrast issue with next hour precipitation graph in light theme
- Fix search failure on Open-Meteo / GeoNames when country code was empty (Antarctica, for example)
- Updated translations.

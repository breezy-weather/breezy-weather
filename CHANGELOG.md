# Version 4.6.8-beta (next version)

**Weather sources**

# Version 4.6.6-beta (2023-09-16)

**Behavior changes**
- Temperature unit will now follow locale preference if it was never defined. Example: you were using the app with the temperature unit set as Celsius (the previous default) in English (US). It will now switch to Fahrenheit (but you can still of course redefine it to something else). This change is mostly to help first-time users having directly their temperature in the unit that makes the most sense to them.

- “Day / Night” option for widget backgrounds was replaced by “Follow app preference” to improve consistency (@Cod3dDOT)

# Version 4.6.0-beta (2023-08-16)

This new version introduces major changes in the way weather refreshes. While it brings nice new features with it, as there are now many different combination for weather sources that we can’t fully test, we welcome your bug reports about any regression introduced in this version, so we can fix them before new release becomes stable.

**New data**
- Yesterday is now shown as a day in daily forecast (on supported sources).
- Temperature normals added (with a fallback to average temperature when not supported by source).
- As a consequence “yesterday temperature lines” have been replaced by “temperature normals lines”.

**Weather refresh**
- If weather source doesn’t already provide it, app will now keep history back to yesterday 00:00. This will allow you to see details of the previous day, and will ensure a day is always full (daytime was notably missing on MET Norway source after 18:00). Works best 48 hours after a location has been added.
- When one or more secondary weather sources fail, app will refresh other sources that succeeded and restore cached data for failing sources. An error will still be displayed to inform you in case you need to take action.
- App will now tell you which source is failing.
- When changing a source, app will now automatically refresh data instead of expecting the user to force refresh manually.
- Secondary weather sources will no longer silently fail.
- Background update will now silently fail in the following cases to avoid unnecessary notification spam: network unavailable, server timeout. No weather update will happen.
- Background update will now silently fail in the following cases to avoid unnecessary notification spam: location permission missing (background location permission missing will still be reported), Android location not enabled, current location could not be found. Weather update will happen with previously found position. If current location was never found at least once, it will be reported as an error (will NOT silently fail).
- App will no longer show any message about data still being valid or refresh restrictions, it will automatically handle it, including merging still valid data with invalid data that just got refreshed (can happen when using multiple sources).

**Weather sources**
- [AccuWeather] Add support for temperature normals.
- [Météo-France] Add support for temperature normals.
- [Météo-France] Add support for temperature normals as a secondary source.

**Design**
- Logo got a refresh.
- Add a third place to the location list icon to not make it confusing with “itinerary” icon.
- A circled dot symbol is now shown next to location name on main screen if using current location.

**Other improvements and fixes**
- Fix incorrect alert source leading to crash in some cases.
- Required swipe distance to go to next location is now 50 % screen width (instead of 20 %) to make it less prone to errors.
- Current location will no longer wait 10 seconds to get a GPS fix if the info is available sooner
- Wind direction is fixed in hourly trends.
- Fix missing credits for secondary features when same as main source.
- Make alerts always take full width on alerts full page

**Translations**
- Initial support for Norwegian Bokmål added (thank you @Visnes!)
- Latvian translation is now complete (thank you Niks Rodžers!)
- Translations updated


# Version 4.5.4-beta (2023-08-10)

Some users reported issues with API limit reached, please check if you use OpenWeather or Pirate Weather as your main or secondary weather source!
Improvements to the error handling will be worked on for next major version.

**Weather sources**
- [PirateWeather] Bundled API key removed as monthly limit was reached on the 10th of the month (meaning it can’t be used again before Sep 1st) and we don’t want make false hopes to users by showing it in the list of available sources.

**Other fixes**
- Fix air quality data disappearing when allergen set as secondary source (but not air quality), and allergen data disappearing when air quality set as secondary source (but not allergen)
- Day / Night mode for locations has been moved to a new preference. It will also apply to some dialogs of the location now (others are still WIP).
- Change location list icon to use multiple place points instead of a bookmark (for "saved" locations)
- Fix clock icon tint on Android versions < 7.0

**Translations**
- Latvian translation added (thanks Eduards Lusts!), only app name translated for the moment
- Translations updated


# Version 4.5.3-beta (2023-08-08)

Emergency fix for current location not working on sources with reverse geocoding feature.


# Version 4.5.2-beta (2023-08-08)

# Version 4.5.0-beta (2023-08-04)

Due to a technical change, cached weather data will be cleared on update.

**New features**
- Support for secondary weather sources, allows you to complete missing data with other sources (air quality, allergens, precipitations by minute, alerts). Available from the “Edit” button in the footer of the main screen.
- IP.SB is now available as an alternative to GPS and Baidu IP Location. It’s based on IP so it provides less accurate results than GPS, but it’s fast and provides rather close results in our experience. Use it if you would like to use current location without giving your exact GPS position to weather source.
- Add a setting to allow changing the default location search source for weather sources which don’t have a location search feature.
- Add GeoNames as optional location search source. This source has fuzzy search support, but is rate-limited so only switch if you need it.
- Add privacy policy of app and sources in the About section (Info icon) of Settings
- Show licenses of our dependencies in the About section (@Cod3dDOT)

- Fix contrast issue on Main screen Allergen card in some cases
- Fix "Material You - Current" widget not being resizable to 2 cells on height (@Cod3dDOT)

# Version 4.4.0-beta (2023-07-25)

This version brings new logic that automatically completes missing data (for example, uses hourly data to extrapolate daily value for this data). This logic which was initially implemented per source is now transparently implemented for all sources. This means that even novice developers that want to add new sources will now be able to do it without having to care about that, making this task easier than ever.

If you notice any data that was available on v4.3.0-beta for a source and is now missing on v4.4.0-beta, please report it in a GitHub issue.

- When current details are missing from a source, app will now pick the closest hour forecast. Following this change, some sources will now have more current details.
- Sun & Moon & Moon phase is now available for all sources, it will be computed if data is missing from source.
- This fixes an issue with MET Norway where icons were always daytime on days 2+ due to missing sun info
- This also fixes many errors with midnight sun and polar night.
- Fix day and night temperature for OpenWeather which was completely broken and could show higher temperature at night than during the day.
- When dew point is missing and relative humidity and air temperature are available, it will be automatically computed.
- When degree day is missing, it will be calculated according to EU formula (check [Day details documentation](docs/DAY_DETAILS.md) for more info).
- When degree day is 0, it will no longer be shown.
- When temperature < 10 °C and wind speed > 4.8 km/h, and wind chill temperature is missing, it will be automatically computed.

- Revert swipe when trying to make the location list empty or cancelling a weather source update on current location.
- Remove clunky last daily forecast on Open-Meteo, MF, MET No, OpenWeather to avoid showing incomplete/incorrect data
- “Alerts to follow” message will no longer take you to past alerts, and alert list page will no longer show past alerts
- Fix contrast issue with next hour precipitation graph in light theme
- Fix search failure on Open-Meteo / GeoNames when country code was empty (Antarctica, for example)
- Updated translations.

Breezy Weather doesn’t collect any personal data.

Optionally, it can access your approximate or precise location to find weather data for your position. This data is shared with weather sources. If you don’t want to share your location, you can deny permissions and choose a city manually.

If you enable the “check for app updates” feature, the app will connect to GitHub every 24 hours at most to get the latest version of Breezy Weather. The version you currently have installed will not be shared with GitHub (it will be compared on device). [GitHub Privacy Policy](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement)

The icon packs feature (which allows you to customize weather icons) requires to list packages installed on your device. It will ignore all packages that don’t match one of these packs: Breezy Weather icon pack, Geometric Weather icon pack, Chronus icon pack. No data is collected, it is only processed at the moment it is needed.

Breezy Weather relies on third-party APIs to get various data such as your current location (if you decide to not use native GPS), location search or weather, please review their privacy policy (from Settings > Info icon > Privacy policy) and only use the ones you agree with.

Breezy Weather can optionally share your location and weather data with other apps. Please review their privacy policy before you decide to grant them permission.

This privacy policy may be updated any time, for example to clarify a use case or in case a feature gets added. In that case, it will be mentioned in the changelog. You can always access the latest version of the privacy policy from Settings > Info icon > Privacy policy.

# Contact us

* If you’d like to report a bug or suggest a new feature, GitHub discussions or issues are best for organization.
* We’ve also created a Matrix/Element space with a number of different channels for more general discussion: [`#breezy-weather-space:matrix.org`](https://matrix.to/#/#breezy-weather-space:matrix.org).
  * If you are not comfortable writing a GitHub discussion/issue in English, you can ask on the channel if someone can help you in your language.
    * We also have a dedicated help channel in French: [`#breezy-weather-francais:matrix.org`](https://matrix.to/#/#breezy-weather-francais:matrix.org)
  * If you’d prefer a direct channel link instead of a space link, here’s the main Breezy Weather Matrix channel: [`#breezy-weather:matrix.org`](https://matrix.to/#/#breezy-weather:matrix.org)


# Status of main requested features

These are time-consuming features and help is always appreciated. A fresh look to help maintain code quality can also be of great help! Please join the [Matrix channel](https://matrix.to/#/#breezy-weather:matrix.org) for that purpose.

# Translations

Translation is done externally [on Weblate](https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/breezy-weather/breezy-weather-android/#information). Please read carefully project instructions if you want to help.

[![Translation progress report](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/300e06706d5aa03ae0333db112b8dce2dff67c698f86af7f95557fc4d081f616/68747470733a2f2f686f737465642e7765626c6174652e6f72672f7769646765742f627265657a792d776561746865722f627265657a792d776561746865722d616e64726f69642f686f72697a6f6e74616c2d6175746f2e737667)](https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/breezy-weather/breezy-weather-android/#information)

English (and regional variants) and French translations are maintained by repo maintainers, but they are open to proofreading/improvements. You will need to make a pull request, as we didn’t find a way to make these languages in suggestion-only mode in Weblate (let us know if you find anything).


# Contact us

* If you’d like to report a bug or suggest a new feature, GitHub discussions or issues are best for organization.
* We’ve also created a Matrix/Element space with a number of different channels for more general discussion: [`#breezy-weather-space:matrix.org`](https://matrix.to/#/#breezy-weather-space:matrix.org).
  * If you are not comfortable writing a GitHub discussion/issue in English, you can ask on the channel if someone can help you in your language.
    * We also have a dedicated help channel in French: [`#breezy-weather-francais:matrix.org`](https://matrix.to/#/#breezy-weather-francais:matrix.org)
  * If you’d prefer a direct channel link instead of a space link, here’s the main Breezy Weather Matrix channel: [`#breezy-weather:matrix.org`](https://matrix.to/#/#breezy-weather:matrix.org)


# Status of main requested features

These are time-consuming features and help is always appreciated. A fresh look to help maintain code quality can also be of great help! Please join the [Matrix channel](https://matrix.to/#/#breezy-weather:matrix.org) for that purpose.

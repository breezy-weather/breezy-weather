# Contribute

Pull requests are welcome. You can have a look at [issues opened to contributions](https://github.com/breezy-weather/breezy-weather/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22Open+to+contributions%22). For other changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.

* [Contribution guide (includes a guide to create a new weather source)](CONTRIBUTE.md)

The following features are currently being worked on by a contributor:
- [#14](https://github.com/breezy-weather/breezy-weather/issues/14), [#252](https://github.com/breezy-weather/breezy-weather/issues/252) - New 24-hour fitting charts - WIP in `better_charts` branch

The following features lack an active contributor to work on it:
- [#10](https://github.com/breezy-weather/breezy-weather/issues/10) - “Add location” page needs a new design, in the spirit of Google Maps where you can select location points on the map, or search manually - No mockup done yet
- Widget overhaul (prerequisite for any new widget improvement) - Some mockups were done but no one is working on it anymore

The following features will not be implemented:
- Paid-only sources (or too limited free-tier)
- Adding `standard` flavor or non-free sources to the F-Droid default repo: please use the `standard` flavor from a different store/source instead
- Changes to the [background updates process](docs/UPDATES.md), including but not limited: options for refreshing less than every 30 minutes, every time you open the app, every time you tap on widget, every time you unlock your phone
- “Circular sky” interface: please set a fixed background per location instead
- Publish to Google Play Store: please [check alternatives](INSTALL.md)
- Donations

Translation is done externally [on Weblate](https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/breezy-weather/breezy-weather-android/#information). Please read carefully project instructions if you want to help.

[![Translation progress report](https://hosted.weblate.org/widget/breezy-weather/breezy-weather-android/multi-auto.svg)](https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/breezy-weather/breezy-weather-android/#information)

English (and regional variants) and French translations are maintained by repo maintainers, but they are open to proofreading/improvements. You will need to make a pull request, as we didn’t find a way to make these languages in suggestion-only mode in Weblate (let us know if you find anything).


# Contact us

* If you’d like to report a bug or suggest a new feature, GitHub discussions or issues are best for organization.
* We’ve also created a Matrix/Element space with a number of different channels for more general discussion: [`#breezy-weather-space:matrix.org`](https://matrix.to/#/#breezy-weather-space:matrix.org).
  * If you are not comfortable writing a GitHub discussion/issue in English, you can ask on the channel if someone can help you in your language.
    * We also have a dedicated help channel in French: [`#breezy-weather-francais:matrix.org`](https://matrix.to/#/#breezy-weather-francais:matrix.org)
  * If you’d prefer a direct channel link instead of a space link, here’s the main Breezy Weather Matrix channel: [`#breezy-weather:matrix.org`](https://matrix.to/#/#breezy-weather:matrix.org)

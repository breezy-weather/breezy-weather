# 🤝 Contribute

Pull requests are welcome. You can have a look at [issues opened to contributions](https://github.com/breezy-weather/breezy-weather/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22Open+to+contributions%22). For other changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.

* [Contribution guide (includes a guide to create a new weather source)](CONTRIBUTE.md)

## Features currently being worked on by a contributor

- [Announcement](https://github.com/breezy-weather/breezy-weather/discussions/2089) - Make Breezy weather data available through a ContentProvider. Landed in v6.1.0. Currently in an experimental phase; feedback appreciated
- [#10](https://github.com/breezy-weather/breezy-weather/issues/10) - “Add location” page needs a new design, in the spirit of Google Maps where you can select location points on the map, or search manually - No mockup done yet

## Features lacking an active contributor

- [#937](https://github.com/breezy-weather/breezy-weather/issues/937) - Widget overhaul (prerequisite for any new widget improvement) - Some mockups were done but no one is working on it anymore

## Features that will not be implemented

- Paid-only sources, too limited free-tier, or free-tier that requires privacy-invasive information (credit card info, phone number, etc)
- Radar; [please check out this document for alternatives](docs/RADAR.md)
- Adding `standard` flavor or non-free sources to the F-Droid default repo: please use the `standard` flavor from a different store/source instead
- Changes to the [background updates process](docs/UPDATES.md), including but not limited: options for refreshing less than every 30 minutes, every time you open the app, every time you tap on widget, every time you unlock your phone
- “Circular sky” interface: please set a fixed background per location instead
- Publish to Google Play Store: please [check alternatives](INSTALL.md)
- Allow different flavors to be installed in parallel
- Implement features that are no longer available in latest Android versions
- Backport features/fixes from latest Android versions to older Android versions
- Donations: if you have extra money to spare, consider [donating to Open-Meteo](https://github.com/sponsors/open-meteo) to support infrastructure costs and future developments (we currently lack a libre and gratis worldwide alternative for the following features: [Reverse geocoding](https://github.com/open-meteo/geocoding-api/issues/6), [Alerts](https://github.com/open-meteo/open-meteo/issues/351), [Normals](https://github.com/open-meteo/open-meteo/issues/361))


# 🌍 Translations

Translation is done externally [on Weblate](https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/breezy-weather/breezy-weather-android/#information). Please read carefully project instructions if you want to help.

[![Translation progress report](https://hosted.weblate.org/widget/breezy-weather/breezy-weather-android/multi-auto.svg)](https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/breezy-weather/breezy-weather-android/#information)

English (and regional variants) and French translations are maintained by repo maintainers, but they are open to proofreading/improvements. You will need to make a pull request, as we didn’t find a way to make these languages in suggestion-only mode in Weblate (let us know if you find anything).

For unit formatting, we use [Unicode data](https://www.unicode.org/cldr/charts/47/summary/root.html) as much as possible. If you believe there is an error, please [open a discussion](https://github.com/breezy-weather/breezy-weather/discussions/categories/general) with evidences that the changes you suggest is the recommendation for your language.


# ✉️ Contact us

  * If you are not comfortable writing a GitHub discussion/issue in English, you can ask on the channel if someone can help you in your language.
    * We also have a dedicated help channel in French: [`#breezy-weather-francais:matrix.org`](https://matrix.to/#/#breezy-weather-francais:matrix.org)

Before creating a fork, check if the intent action `nodomain.freeyourgadget.gadgetbridge.ACTION_GENERIC_WEATHER` can cover your need (for example, you want to re-use our weather data in your own customized widget). It can be enabled from Settings > Widgets & Live Wallpaper > Data sharing. You can also [help testing our `ContentProvider` exposing the full weather data of Breezy Weather](https://github.com/breezy-weather/breezy-weather/discussions/2089).

Otherwise, remember to:

- Respect the project’s LICENSE
- Avoid confusion with the Breezy Weather app:
  - Do NOT use the `breezy` flag when compiling releases you plan to distribute
  - Change the app name in [`res_fork/values/strings.xml`](https://github.com/breezy-weather/breezy-weather/blob/main/app/src/res_fork/values/strings.xml)
  - Change the app icons in the [`res_fork`](https://github.com/breezy-weather/breezy-weather/blob/main/app/src/res_fork) folders
  - Avoid installation conflicts: change the `applicationId` in [`build.gradle.kts`](https://github.com/breezy-weather/breezy-weather/blob/main/app/build.gradle.kts#L25)
